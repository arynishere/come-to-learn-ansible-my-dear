# Ansible Command Line Switches

This repository provides explanations for several useful command line switches in Ansible.

## `--diff`

This switch shows the differences between the expected configuration and the current state of the managed system. It provides a side-by-side comparison of changes that Ansible intends to make.

Example:
```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --diff
```

## `--syntax-check`

This switch performs a syntax check on the provided Ansible playbook or role. It checks for syntax errors without actually executing the playbook.

Example:
```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --syntax-check
```

## `--check`

When this switch is used, Ansible runs in check mode, previewing changes without actually applying them to the target system.

Example:
```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --check
```

## `--tags`

This switch allows you to specify specific tags associated with tasks in your playbook. Only tasks with the specified tags will be executed.

Example:
```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --tags webserver,dbserver
```

## `--skip-tags`

This switch allows you to skip tasks that have specific tags associated with them. Tasks with the specified tags will be excluded from execution.

Example:
```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --skip-tags security,backup
```

## `--step`

When this switch is used, Ansible will execute the playbook interactively, prompting for confirmation before each task. It is helpful for debugging and understanding the impact of each task.

Example:
```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --step
```

These switches provide additional control and flexibility when running Ansible playbooks, allowing you to preview changes, check syntax, select specific tasks, and more.
